#### Proposal Title:
zk-Lokomotive: Fully Secure and Trustless Multichain File Transfer System
![Logo](https://github.com/zk-Lokomotive/zk-lokomotive-MINA/assets/158029357/0a46fdde-4c8a-434f-a869-fd5740b63fac)

#### Proposal Overview

**Problem:** Traditional file transfer services lack sufficient privacy and security, especially for sensitive data. Centralized servers bring risks of data breaches and privacy violations.

**Solution:** zk-Lokomotive aims to create a secure and efficient file transfer system using ZK proofs, IPFS and Wormhole by combining Mina and Ethereum networks. This ensures file integrity and confidentiality, facilitates decentralized storage and enables cross-chain data transfer. Unlike traditional cryptographic solutions, the hashes sent to verify the integrity of the file or the authenticity of the origin are sent to a central server instead of a centralized server. By eliminating the "trust factor" completely, we aim to enable the companies or institutions we serve to transmit files in a confidential, secure and verifiable manner.

**Impact:** This project extends and enhances the Mina ecosystem by opening it to EVM-based users by enabling secure file transfers using zk-SNARKs, encouraging adoption, providing improved tools, and attracting more users and developers. Enables new applications for secure data sharing in blockchain ecosystems.

**Audience:** The target audience consists of researchers, developers and enterprises that need secure and verifiable file transfers.

### Architecture & Design

**Detailed Design/Architecture:**

**Mina-EVM File Transfer:**
- Cross-Chain Bridge:**
  - The transmitter encrypts the file with [zk-SNARK] o1js (merkle tree contract) and verifies it in the MINA network.
  - The files to be sent are tagged in IPFS in 256kb packets and the hash is transmitted over the MINA network.
  - After the files are verified on the network with zk, the receiver can pull the necessary files from IPFS.
- Wormhole Integration:**
  - Transfer tokenized files using Wormhole to facilitate cross-chain communication.
  - Verify the file using zk-SNARK proof when receiving it into the EVM network.
  - Retrieve the file from IPFS and verify its integrity using zk-SNARK proof.

**IPFS Integration:**
- **File Storage:** Use IPFS for decentralized file storage. Encrypt files before uploading and store the resulting hash on Mina.
- **Proof Verification:** Retrieve files from IPFS using hash and verify their integrity with the provided zk-SNARK proof.
**IPFS Integration:**
- **File Storage:** Use IPFS for decentralized file storage. Encrypt files before uploading and store the resulting hash on Mina.
- **Proof Verification:** Retrieve files from IPFS using hash and verify their integrity with the provided zk-SNARK proof.

### Vision

- The long-term vision includes adding support for more blockchain networks, enhancing privacy and security features, and developing a user-friendly interface for wider adoption.
- We also plan to organize Hackathons and CTFs in the MINA ecosystem to increase the customer growth rate of B2B sales.
